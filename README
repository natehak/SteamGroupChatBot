Steam Group Chat Bot
---------------------

By Nathan Hakkakzadeh (or DrKabob on Steam, or /u/drkabob on Reddit, even @drkabob on
Twitter, and finally I have a swell website http://welcometonathan.com/)

If you want to know how to set the bot up, you should view the SETUP file.

If you want to learn how to use the bot, you should view the USE file.

The license for this code can be found in the LICENSE file.

What is the Steam Group Chat Bot?
----------------------------------
The Steam Group Chat bot is an answer to a problem in Steam. On Steam, if a user leaves
a group chat the user cannot rejoin the chat unless he or she is reinvited. This can be
problematic for small groups who want to have an ongoing chat. This bot solves that
problem.

What do I get?
--------------
Included is the most recent (and relatively stable) source code for the bot. For a ready
to go, just-add-water, precompiled, let's just launch this thing, version of the bot,
look in the bin directory. It will contain the bot executable, example configuration
files, and the required libraries.

If I just want a private chat, but don't want to setup this thing, what do I do?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have a ready to go instance of the bot. Add this user on Steam as a friend
(http://steamcommunity.com/id/groupchatbot) to get connected to the bot. Then, send me
a message on Steam, Reddit, E-mail, or through the bot and I'll set up the channel for
you. Please understand that it may take a while for me to get to your message.

Thanks for looking around! If you have any questions you can get ahold of me on Steam
(http://steamcommunity.com/id/natman97/), Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/u/drkabob/), or
